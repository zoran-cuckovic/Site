<b>Abstract: </b>More
 than 1,000 Bronze and Iron Age hillforts can be listed for the eastern 
Adriatic region. These constructions left a mark on the landscape which 
is still perceptible today. In some cases, such as the island of Lošinj,
 this density is challenging to explain: almost thirty hillfort (or 
simply hilltop) sites were recorded on a rugged island with an area of 
74km<sup>2</sup>. Different factors potentially involved in the 
formation of this settlement pattern are discussed (territorial control,
 surveillance, control of maritime networks), only to show that without 
considering some kind of symbolic display a plausible explanatory model 
cannot be devised. A new reading of the coastal seascape is proposed, 
inspired in part by costly signalling theory. Hillfort construction is 
interpreted as a discursive practice geared towards assertive display in
 front of potential seafarers.<br />
