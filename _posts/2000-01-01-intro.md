I’m an archaeologist studying past landscapes and social memory. Landscapes comprise many things: rural and urban settlements, field systems, vegetation cover and geology, ritual places and monuments – and much more. My approach puts space before place, I study connections between sites across the space and all the possibilities offered by such space. I also study how ancient populations got to know their space, what they made of it, and how such space made them think about themselves.  

I’ve obtained a PhD degree at the University of Burgundy Franche-Comté (France). Previously I worked as professional archaeologist in Croatia, and currently I'm research associate at the University of Clermont-Auvergne (France).
