I’m an archaeologist studying past landscapes and social memory. Landscape can be many things: a configuration of rural or urban sites, ancient field systems, local vegetation cover and geology, ritual places and monuments – and then all these things combined. In my work, landscape stands for an approach that puts space before place. More precisely, I study how ancient populations got to know their space, what they made of it, and how such space made them think about themselves.  

Currently I’m a PhD candidate at the University of Burgundy Franche-Comté, France. Previously I worked as professional archaeologist in Croatia.
