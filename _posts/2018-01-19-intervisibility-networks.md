<b>Abstract</b>: Using the rich archaeological record of 480 hillfort sites during the Bronze and Iron Age in Istria (Croatia and Slovenia), we have attempted to build a structured approach for investigating intervisibility networks. This analysis is organized in three steps. An exploratory analysis of visual connections is first carried out, particularly focusing on the relationship between the lengths of connection between sites and the network structure. Next, two new indices of integration of individual sites into the network are proposed and analyzed (connection success and visual neighborhood index). Finally, an approach for examining the statistical relevance of the<br />
observed network is proposed.<br />
