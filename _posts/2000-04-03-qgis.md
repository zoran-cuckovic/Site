# QGIS projects

## ... and other techy stuff

This site covers my Github account, which hosts two actively maintained QGIS modules:

 - [**Visibility analysis**](https://zoran-cuckovic.from.hr/QGIS-visibility-analysis/) module, which is widely used by GISers worldwide
 - [**Terrain Shading**](https://zoran-cuckovic.from.hr/QGIS-terrain-shading/) module, made for analytical terrain visualisation of elevation data (eg. Lidar derived)

You can explore the [GitHub account](https://github.com/zoran-cuckovic) here, although itâ€™s not really exemplary...
