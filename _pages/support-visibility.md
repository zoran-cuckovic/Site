## Goal for the next major version: *integration into processing toolbox*

Many QGIS users have experessed a wish to integrate visibilty analysis in custom scripts. That would be, indeed, a very useful thing. For instance, one would be able to combine viewshed with morphpometry and other terrain analyses, or do some complex statistics in a batch. However, this would imply a major overhaul of the code, which is much more work than occasional bug-fixes.
