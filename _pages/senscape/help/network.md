## Intervisibility network

Intervisibility network is calculated between two sets of points, created by the *create viewpoints* routine. It will produce a set of lines joining chosen viewpoints based on the distance parameter and *regardless of their mutual visibilty*. True visibilty connections can be filtered from the associated table.
