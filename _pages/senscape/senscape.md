Senscape is a QGIS plugin for modelling human landscape experience. It is based on [QGIS Viewshed analysis module](http://zoran-cuckovic.from.hr/landscape-analysis/visibility/), and represents its adaptation to QGIS processing framework (which means it can be used in custom models and scripts).

Current version (0.1) is experimental and not yet fully tested.

## Installation

1. Search for "Senscape" in QGIS plugin manager (make sure experimental plugins are allowed)

2. In Processing menu, under Options, allow Senscape provider
