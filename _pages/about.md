The main topic of these pages is archaeology of (past) landscapes; an exploration of the historical dimension of spaces we inhabit.   

*Aux quatre vents* is intended to be a personal publishing platform, rather than just a blog. The idea is to communicate bits and pieces of current academic work, in particular those that are less likely to grow into full fledged scientitfic articles (or is that laziness..?). It has an ISSN code and is regularly archived, which means you can safely quote.
