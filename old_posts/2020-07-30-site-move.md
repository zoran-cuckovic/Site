This site began as my experimental blog, but at one point I decided to divide the contents. From now on, you can find my academic stuff at [zoran.hcommons.org](https://zoran.hcommons.org) and GIS / lansdcape archaeology topics at [LandscapeArchaeology.org](https://landscapearchaeology.org).

Salve, 
Zoran
